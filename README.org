#+title: John's Garage

This repo serves as a place that consolidates all of my services that I run in my home laboratory along with all of the instructions and config files necessary to get these applications up and running. 

* Structure

Each service has its own directory and within each service directory contains subdirectories that specify the major services used for setup. This is done so that replicating would be easy â€” minimal changes needed to get things working.


* Docker

To be consistent with the philosophy of reproducibility, =docker-compose.yaml= files are used if possible. 

It is important to note that the docker compose files may have a =.env= file that must be created within the same directory as the =docker-compose.yaml=.
