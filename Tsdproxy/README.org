#+title: Tsdproxy

* Docker

** Setup

Must define a volume named =tsdproxydata= using the following shell command to be used:

#+begin_src shell

  docker volume create tsdproxydata

#+end_src

An alternative is to create a file in the file system which would be preferred. If that is the case then make sure you specify a =./= to indicate that it is a file on the filesystem.
