#+title: Navidrome


* Docker

** General Troubleshooting

*** Not all Tracks Appearing in Album

This is usually do to the fact that navidrome scanned that directory already and after naidrome has scanned, it will not scan again â€” may have to do with keeping things smooth and fast. Thus, you should run the following command with the container still running so that it will force scan the entire library.

#+begin_src shell
sudo docker-compose exec navidrome /app/navidrome scan -f
#+end_src

** =docker-tsdproxy=

=tsdproxy= is used as a proxy server for services hosted on the *Tailscale* network. 

*** Labels

For =tsdproxy= to work, you must pass label variables in the =docker-compose.yaml=.

#+begin_src shell

  tsdproxy.enable: "true"
  tsdproxy.name: "navidrome"

#+end_src

=tsdproxy= will bind to the docker socket of the host machine to find containers with the =tsdproxy.*= labels to create a machine on the *Tailscale* network.
